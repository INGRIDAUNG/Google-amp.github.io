    <h1>I have never ever been sexually attracted to anyone.</h1>
    <p>Ever felt that spark of excitement when you accidentally brushed the hand of the person you like? Or what about the "love at first sight" feeling of butterflies when looking at someone?</p>
    <p>Well, I have never had that feeling for anyone. Ever. And this is because I am asexual, a lesser-known sexual orientation.</p>
    <p>Today, I am going to respond to some of the questions and common misconceptions people have toward the one per cent who do not feel sexually attracted to anyone.</p>
    <p>The most common question: Does asexuality really exist?</p>
    <p>Although less commonly seen or experienced than heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality, asexuality has existed for just as long as the other orientations.</p>
    <p>Some think that asexuality is an excuse that unappealing people make up to explain why they aren't in a relationship. But it isn't.</p>
